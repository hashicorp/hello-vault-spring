# hello-vault-spring

Runnable examples of how to integrate a Java Spring Boot application with
HashiCorp [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), using the community-maintained
[Spring Vault](https://spring.io/projects/spring-vault) library.

All examples here run Vault in `-dev` mode which is insecure and should not be run in production, but these examples can be a good starting point to learn from.

## [Quick Start](./quick-start/)

This is a simple example of reading and writing your first secret!

## [Sample Application](./sample-app/)

Here you will find a more realistic example that demonstrates many important
concepts, including authentication, static and dynamic secrets.
